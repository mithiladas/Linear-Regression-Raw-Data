# Linear-Regression-Raw-Data
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the implementation of linear regression from scratch using Python.

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the implementation of linear regression from scratch using Python, comparing three approaches:

    1. Basic Python implementation – Calculating slope and intercept manually.
    2. NumPy-based approach – Using vectorized operations for efficiency.
    3. Scikit-learn version – Leveraging machine learning libraries for professional-grade modeling.

The notebook includes:
    1. Step-by-step error analysis and visualization
    2. Comparison of squared errors across data points
    3. Scatter plots and regression line fitting
    4. Evaluation metrics (MSE, R² score)

Perfect for learning regression fundamentals, experimenting with raw data, and understanding the transition from manual calculations to optimized library use.
